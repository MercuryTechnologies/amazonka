module Amazonka.IoTJobsData.Waiters


-- | Derived from API version <tt>2017-09-29</tt> of the AWS service
--   descriptions, licensed under Apache 2.0.
--   
--   AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs —
--   remote operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices
--   connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs
--   a set of devices to download and install application or firmware
--   updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote
--   troubleshooting operations.
--   
--   To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the
--   remote operations to be performed, and you specify a list of targets
--   that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual
--   things, thing groups or both.
--   
--   AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is
--   available. The target starts the execution of the job by downloading
--   the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and
--   reporting its progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs service provides commands
--   to track the progress of a job on a specific target and for all the
--   targets of the job
