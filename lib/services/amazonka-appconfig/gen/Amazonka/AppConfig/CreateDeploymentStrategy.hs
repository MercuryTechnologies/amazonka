-- A deployment strategy defines important criteria for rolling out your
-- configuration to the designated targets. A deployment strategy includes:
-- the overall duration required, a percentage of targets to receive the
-- deployment during each interval, an algorithm that defines how
-- percentage grows, and bake time.

    --
    -- __Linear__: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by
    -- dividing the total number of targets by the value specified for
    -- @Step percentage@. For example, a linear deployment that uses a
    -- @Step percentage@ of 10 deploys the configuration to 10 percent of the
    -- hosts. After those deployments are complete, the system deploys the
    -- configuration to the next 10 percent. This continues until 100% of the
    -- targets have successfully received the configuration.
    --
    -- __Exponential__: For this type, AppConfig processes the deployment
    -- exponentially using the following formula: @G*(2^N)@. In this formula,
    -- @G@ is the growth factor specified by the user and @N@ is the number of
    -- steps until the configuration is deployed to all targets. For example,

    --
    -- @2*(2^0)@
    --
    -- @2*(2^1)@

    -- @2*(2^2)@
    --
