-- Generates an activation code and activation ID you can use to register
-- your on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) with Amazon Web Services
-- Systems Manager. Registering these machines with Systems Manager makes
-- it possible to manage them using Systems Manager capabilities. You use
-- the activation code and ID when installing SSM Agent on machines in your
-- hybrid environment. For more information about requirements for managing
-- on-premises instances and VMs using Systems Manager, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for hybrid environments>
-- in the /Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide/.
--
-- On-premises servers or VMs that are registered with Systems Manager and
-- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage with
-- Systems Manager are all called /managed instances/.
