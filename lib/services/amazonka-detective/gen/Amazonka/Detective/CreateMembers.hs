--
-- Sends a request to invite the specified AWS accounts to be member
-- accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be called by the
-- administrator account for a behavior graph.
--
-- @CreateMembers@ verifies the accounts and then invites the verified
-- accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send
-- invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the
-- administrator manages their member accounts centrally.
--
-- The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to
-- invite.
--
-- The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:
--
-- -   The accounts that @CreateMembers@ was able to start the verification
--     for. This list includes member accounts that are being verified,
--     that have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have
--     failed verification.
--
-- -   The accounts that @CreateMembers@ was unable to process. This list
--     includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in
--     the behavior graph.
