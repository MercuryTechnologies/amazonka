-- | Properties describing a game session.
--
-- A game session in ACTIVE status can host players. When a game session
-- ends, its status is set to @TERMINATED@.
--
-- Once the session ends, the game session object is retained for 30 days.
-- This means you can reuse idempotency token values after this time. Game
-- session logs are retained for 14 days.
