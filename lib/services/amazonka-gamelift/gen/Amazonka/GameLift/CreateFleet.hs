--
-- Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
-- to host your custom game server or Realtime Servers. Use this operation
-- to configure the computing resources for your fleet and provide
-- instructions for running game servers on each instance.
--
-- Most GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations,
-- including the home Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional
-- set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following AWS
-- Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2
-- (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland), ap-southeast-2
-- (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets
-- that are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the
-- fleet\'s home Region only. All fleet instances use the same
-- configuration regardless of location; however, you can adjust capacity
-- settings and turn auto-scaling on\/off for each location.
--
-- To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a
-- game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime
-- configuration to direct GameLift how to start and run game servers on
-- each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound traffic to your
-- game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When creating a
-- multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.
--
-- If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it
-- in @NEW@ status, which prompts GameLift to initiate the
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creation-workflow.html fleet creation workflow>.
-- You can track fleet creation by checking fleet status using
-- DescribeFleetAttributes and DescribeFleetLocationAttributes\/, or by
-- monitoring fleet creation events using DescribeFleetEvents. As soon as
-- the fleet status changes to @ACTIVE@, you can enable automatic scaling
-- for the fleet with PutScalingPolicy and set capacity for the home Region
-- with UpdateFleetCapacity. When the status of each remote location
-- reaches @ACTIVE@, you can set capacity by location using
-- UpdateFleetCapacity.
