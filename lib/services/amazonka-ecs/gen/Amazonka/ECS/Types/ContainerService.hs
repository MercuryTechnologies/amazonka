--
-- There are two service scheduler strategies available:
--
-- -   @REPLICA@-The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the
--     desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service
--     scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
--     placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement
--     decisions.
--
-- -   @DAEMON@-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on
--     each active container instance that meets all of the task placement
--     constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler
--     also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and
--     will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints.
--
--     Fargate tasks do not support the @DAEMON@ scheduling strategy.
containerService_schedulingStrategy :: Lens.Lens' ContainerService (Prelude.Maybe SchedulingStrategy)
containerService_schedulingStrategy = Lens.lens (\ContainerService' {schedulingStrategy} -> schedulingStrategy) (\s@ContainerService' {} a -> s {schedulingStrategy = a} :: ContainerService)

-- | The period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler
-- ignores unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a
-- task has first started.
containerService_healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds :: Lens.Lens' ContainerService (Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Int)
containerService_healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds = Lens.lens (\ContainerService' {healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds} -> healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds) (\s@ContainerService' {} a -> s {healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds = a} :: ContainerService)

-- | The VPC subnet and security group configuration for tasks that receive
-- their own elastic network interface by using the @awsvpc@ networking
-- mode.

-- | The capacity provider strategy the service is using. When using the
-- DescribeServices API, this field is omitted if the service was created
-- using a launch type.
containerService_capacityProviderStrategy :: Lens.Lens' ContainerService (Prelude.Maybe [CapacityProviderStrategyItem])
containerService_capacityProviderStrategy = Lens.lens (\ContainerService' {capacityProviderStrategy} -> capacityProviderStrategy) (\s@ContainerService' {} a -> s {capacityProviderStrategy = a} :: ContainerService) Prelude.. Lens.mapping Lens.coerced

-- | Whether or not the execute command functionality is enabled for the
-- service. If @true@, the execute command functionality is enabled for all
-- containers in tasks as part of the service.
containerService_enableExecuteCommand :: Lens.Lens' ContainerService (Prelude.Maybe Prelude.Bool)
containerService_enableExecuteCommand = Lens.lens (\ContainerService' {enableExecuteCommand} -> enableExecuteCommand) (\s@ContainerService' {} a -> s {enableExecuteCommand = a} :: ContainerService)

-- | The metadata that you apply to the service to help you categorize and
-- organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
-- which you define.
--
-- The following basic restrictions apply to tags:
--
-- -   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50
--
-- -   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can
--     have only one value.
--
-- -   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8
--
-- -   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8
--
-- -   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and
--     resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on
--     allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters,
--     numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following
--     characters: + - = . _ : \/ \@.
--
-- -   Tag keys and values are case-sensitive.
--
-- -   Do not use @aws:@, @AWS:@, or any upper or lowercase combination of
--     such as a prefix for either keys or values as it is reserved for
--     Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys or
--     values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against
--     your tags per resource limit.

-- Amazon ECS container agent to register container instances with an
-- Elastic Load Balancing load balancer.
