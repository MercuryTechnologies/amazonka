-- | A single Suricata rules specification, for use in a stateful rule group.
-- Use this option to specify a simple Suricata rule with protocol, source
-- and destination, ports, direction, and rule options. For information
-- about the Suricata @Rules@ format, see
-- <https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-5.0.0/rules/intro.html# Rules Format>.

    -- flow when the flow matches the stateful rule criteria. For all actions,
    -- Network Firewall performs the specified action and discontinues stateful
    -- inspection of the traffic flow.
    --
    -- The actions for a stateful rule are defined as follows:
    --
    -- -   __PASS__ - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination.
    --
    -- -   __DROP__ - Blocks the packets from going to the intended destination
    --     and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in
    --     the Firewall LoggingConfiguration.
    --
    -- -   __ALERT__ - Permits the packets to go to the intended destination
    --     and sends an alert log message, if alert logging is configured in
    --     the Firewall LoggingConfiguration.
    --
    --     You can use this action to test a rule that you intend to use to
    --     drop traffic. You can enable the rule with @ALERT@ action, verify in
    --     the logs that the rule is filtering as you want, then change the
    --     action to @DROP@.
