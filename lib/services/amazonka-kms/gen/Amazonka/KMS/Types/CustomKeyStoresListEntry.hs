    --
    -- -   @INTERNAL_ERROR@ - KMS could not complete the request due to an

    -- -   @NETWORK_ERRORS@ - Network errors are preventing KMS from connecting

    --     configuration, attempts to connect the custom key store to the
    --     CloudHSM cluster fail. To fix this error, create a cluster from a

    --     CloudHSM cluster, you must change the @kmsuser@ account password and

    --
    -- -   @USER_LOGGED_IN@ - The @kmsuser@ CU account is logged into the the
    --     associated CloudHSM cluster. This prevents KMS from rotating the
    --     @kmsuser@ account password and logging into the cluster. Before you
    --     can connect your custom key store to its CloudHSM cluster, you must
